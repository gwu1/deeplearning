# Deep Learning
This repo keeps track of my learning of AI from deeplearning.ai.

Enrolled and completed courses:

1. [LangChain for LLM Application Development](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/accomplishments/4f33314b-1dea-4edd-b30f-c79f03a74191?usp=sharing) - Use the powerful and extensible LangChain framework, using prompts, parsing, memory, chains, question answering, and agents.

2. Quantization Fundamentals with Hugging Face - Learn how to quantize any open-source model. Learn to compress models with the Hugging Face Transformers library and the Quanto library.

3. Build LLM Apps with LangChain.js - Expand your toolkit with LangChain.js, a JavaScript framework for building with LLMs. Understand the fundamentals of using LangChain to orchestrate and chain modules.

4. Preprocessing Unstructured Data for LLM Applications - Improve your RAG system to retrieve diverse data types. Learn to extract and normalize content from a wide variety of document types, such as PDFs, PowerPoints, and HTML files.

5. Evaluating and Debugging Generative AI - Learn MLOps tools for managing, versioning, debugging, and experimenting in your ML workflow.

6. Vector Databases: from Embeddings to Applications - Design and execute real-world applications of vector databases. Build efficient, practical applications, including hybrid and multilingual searches.

7. Building Applications with Vector Databases - Learn to build six applications powered by vector databases, including semantic search, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and anomaly detection.

8. Efficiently Serving LLMs - Understand how LLMs predict the next token and how techniques like KV caching can speed up text generation. Write code to serve LLM applications efficiently to multiple users.
